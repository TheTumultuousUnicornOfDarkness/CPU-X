    (option --dump-bin).

    be supported later if vendors contribute code or documentation.
  - Run-time detection of EFI, so that a single binary can support
    Intel-based Macintosh machines and regular x86 machines.

Version 2.8 (Sat Feb 04 2006)
  - Option --string has four additional keywords available:
    system-uuid, chassis-type, processor-family and processor-frequency.
    These needed additional work because, technically speaking, they are
    not DMI strings.
  - IPMI interface type SSIF was added. This is a new interface type
    defined by IPMI 2.0.
  - (vpddecode) New --string option, much similar in spirit to
    dmidecode's. Available keywords are bios-build-id, box-serial-number,
    motherboard-serial-number, machine-type-model and bios-release-date.
  - (vpddecode) 9 product names were added to the lookup table.
  -  A few bug fixes, cleanups and minor improvements all around the place.

Version 2.7 (Thu Aug 04 2005)
  - New command line interface. For example, it is now possible to limit
    the output of dmidecode to a given DMI type, or to extract a single
    string from the DMI table. The documentation has been updated
    accordingly.
  - The default output of dmidecode was slightly modified to be more
    easily readable by humans. This might break tools parsing its output.
    Such tools may benefit from the new command line interface, although
    this interface shouldn't be considered stable until version 2.8.
  - (vpddecode) New command line interface.
  - (vpddecode) 6 product names were added.
